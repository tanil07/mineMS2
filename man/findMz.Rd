\title{Finding a spectrum or a m/z difference}
\usage{
findMz(m2l, mz, type = c("S", "L"), ppm = 15, dmz = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{m2l}{ms2Lib object}

\item{mz}{A double giving the mass to be searched.}

\item{type}{The data to be search, "S" for spectra and "L" for m/z differences}

\item{ppm}{The tolerance in ppm}

\item{dmz}{The minimum tolerance in Da, if the ppm tolerance is lower in Da than this threshold, this threshold is selected.}
}
\value{
A character vector giving the IDs of the found m/z differences or elements.
}
\description{
Search for a spectrum (S) or a m/z difference (L) in an ms2Lib object given a tolerance in ppm or dmz.
}
\examples{
#' #Loading the data
data(m2l)

#Finding a spectrum (or several spectra) with a precusor mass of 391.1398 with a tolerance of 0.01
findMz(m2l, 391.1398, "S", dmz=0.01)

#Finding an m/z difference of 147 with a tolerance of 0.01
findMz(m2l, 147, "L",dmz=0.1)
