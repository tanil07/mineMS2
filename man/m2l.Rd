\description{
The dataset contains 51 MS/MS spectra from secondary metabolites of 
Penicillium nordicum (one spectrum per compound) acquired with a Data 
Dependent Analysis (DDA) approach on a HPLC system (Luna C18 column; 
Phenomenex) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
operated in the positive ionization mode at a HCD20 collision energy and a 
resolution of 7,500.
