#' The dataset contains 51 MS/MS spectra from secondary metabolites of 
#' Penicillium nordicum (one spectrum per compound) acquired with a Data 
#' Dependent Analysis (DDA) approach on a HPLC system (Luna C18 column; 
#' Phenomenex) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap XL hybrid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
#' operated in the positive ionization mode at a HCD20 collision energy and a 
#' resolution of 7,500.
